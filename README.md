This project explored different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to  predict and study the market value of professional football players based on their characteristics and football attributes and compare it with their actual transfer value, to determine whether a player is overvalued, undervalued, or accurately valued and to also check the features that affects the market value the most. I explored several model design ideas and evaluate their performances against benchmark techniques.
